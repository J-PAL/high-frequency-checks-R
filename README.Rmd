The High Frequncy check template R zip file has the following folders:

1. R script
2. Stata do file

The R script folder has the following files:

1. `HFC_template.R`
2. `dummy_main.dta`

The Stata do file folder has the following files:

1. `HFC_template_2.do`
2. `dummy_main.dta`

Ideally, a participant can read through the annotated R script and try each step by runnning the R script using `dummy_data.dta` as a dummy dataset in lieu of actual survey data.

If the participant is comfortable with Stata, the equivalence can also be checked.
